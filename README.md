Python pandas library has been used on the weather dataset to filter data by:
Finding all records where the weather was exactly clear.
Finding the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
Checking if there are any NULL values present in the dataset.
Renaming the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
Finding the mean visibility of the dataset.
Finding the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
Finding the mean value of each column for each weather condition.
Finding all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
Finding the number of weather conditions that include snow.
